Sticky Note
===========

This module is meant to be a utility module for everybody working with Backdrop
websites: developers, admins, editors to communicate with one another about
their content or keep todo lists on ANY pages (not only nodes!), thus the name
Sticky Note.

How it works
------------
This module creates a block with the ability to add, delete, and edit notes.
Sticky Notes are stored on a per path basis and the block can be made visible to
certain roles/paths etc. like any other block.

It is best to place the Sticky Note block in the website's footer area.

Installation
------------

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.

- Visit the configuration page under Administration > Configuration > Content Authoring >

Managing the sticky notes
-------------------------
